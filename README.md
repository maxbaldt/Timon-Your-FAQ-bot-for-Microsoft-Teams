**Timon** [Team on], or **Tima** in Swedish, are adoption bots for Microsoft Teams.

######  ✔️ They each answer +100 common user questions about... Teams! 😉
######  ✔️ They import into your Power Virtual Agents Teams app (If you follow the guide).
######  ✔️ They help users send questions/feedback to your internal experts.
######  ✔️ And by doing all that, they can save you time and money while users learn to use Teams.
    
It takes less than 2 hours (most use about 30-45 minutes!) to set up and deploy Timon for your own organization. Once deployed, you can tailor Timon to suit your users' own needs.
